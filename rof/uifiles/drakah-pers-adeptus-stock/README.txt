Introduction:
*** ALWAYS use a fresh installation of an interface!

Interface Specific Information:
~ Spell Icons and Book by T.King


Installation:
(please note: the ZIP file was created by ZIP'ing the actual folder)

1) Extract ZIP file into your EverQuest/uifiles directory.

2) Double check the extraction! Many people find they have a folder-inside-of-a-folder and the UI will fail to load.
Your UI folder structure, as an example, should look like this:

o Everuest
o o uifiles
o o o {Interface Folder Name}




The following information will help setup your UI windows as it was intended.

NOTES:
- Your resolution may not be listed in the UI INI file and you may have to adjust the windows by hand.
- Be sure to remember to unlock/lock the windows.
- Some windows have a transparent background/border, so you will need to find the hotspot to move the window once unlocked in game.
- The UI folder name must be the same name as it is listed at the top of this Readme file in order for the UI INI file to work correctly.


You can load the UI for your character by using either of these methods:

Method 1:
* Includes window locations and customized filters.

- DO NOT have EverQuest running.
- Backup your current UI_Charactername_servername.ini file from your EverQuest main directory.
- Rename the "UI_Drakah_adeptus.ini" file from the UI folder to your Character Name and Server Name accordingly, and paste it into your EverQuest main directory. (example: UI_Drakah_xegony.ini)
- Launch EverQuest
- Adjust windows/filtering if needed.


Method 2:
* Only updates the window locations and filtering unchanged.

- You CAN have EverQuest running.
- Copy the "UI_Drakah_adeptus.ini" file from the UI folder and paste it into your EverQuest main directory.
- Go to your Options Window, click the "Copy Layout" button, and select the UI_Drakah_adeptus.ini" file for your resolution, and click Copy.
- Adjust windows/filtering if needed.





ENJOY!
